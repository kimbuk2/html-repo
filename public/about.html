<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>In my role as owner of our demo environments at Salesforce, I get to collaborate with amazing individuals on our Non-Profit and Education teams. I adore technology, but I'm also deeply committed to the arts and building an inclusive outdoor community. I play the cello with Intramural Musicians, am on the associate board of the Colorado Symphony, and spend as much time as I can volunteering with outdoor-focused organizations.
  On the daily, you'll find me weightlifting, mountain biking, snowboarding, playing video games, reading, or more recently, experimenting with cooking.
  Reach out to connect, let's build community together!</p>
